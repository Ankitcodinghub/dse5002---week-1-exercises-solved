Exercise 2

Show that x is less than z but greater than y.

Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.

#your code below

Exercise 3

Show that x and y do not equal z.

Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.

#your code here

Exercise 4

Show that the formula x + 2y = z.

Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean

#your code below

Exercise 5

I have created a vector (test_vector) of integers for you. Determine if any of x, y, or z are in the vector. Note: your output must be a SINGLE boolean, do not output a boolean for each expression.

test_vector &lt;- c(1,5,11:22) #your code below

Exercise 6

Show which value is contained in the test vector. To do this you will need to create an element-wise logical vector using operators. x == vector. Once you have done that you will need to use slicing to return all indices that have matches. Note: your output should be two integers

#your code below
